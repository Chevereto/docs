# ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install Chevereto it requires a server environment where the software and uploaded files will be served. This server can be anywhere, but it must be configured to run Chevereto properly.

::: warning Requirements
Always check that the server for Chevereto provides the [requirements](../setup/system/requirements.md) required to run Chevereto. Don't ignore the system messages mentioning lack of server software as those are detections in the application layer.
