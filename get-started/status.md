* PHP updates
* Software bugs
* Deprecated dependencies

Once Chevereto V3.20 LTS ends this version will stop getting updates and tech support as it follows the PHP version 7.4 eol.

## Long run

Chevereto V3.20 LTS was built using [Ubuntu 20.04](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) and thanks to this you should be able to run V3.20 based systems until **2025-04**.
