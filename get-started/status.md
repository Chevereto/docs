ðŸ”¥ Chevereto V3.20: Long Term Support (LTS) until **2022-11** (PHP 7.4 eol).

Long Term Support means that Chevereto V3 is getting active maintenance, including:

* Security updates
* PHP updates
* Software bugs
* Deprecated dependencies

Once Chevereto V3.20 LTS ends this version will stop getting updates and tech support as it follows the PHP version end-of-life.

## Long run

Chevereto V3.20 LTS was built using [Ubuntu 20.04](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa) and thanks to this you will be able to run V3.20 based systems until **2025-04**.
