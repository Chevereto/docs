## Lifespan

Chevereto V3.20 LTS was made for **PHP 7.4**, which has [active support](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) until 2022-11-28. Using [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) stack you could be able to extend the lifespan of V3.20 based systems to at most [2025-04](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).

| PHP 7.4 EOL | Ubuntu 20.04 EOS |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 2022-11-28  | 2025-04          |

Support provided by Ubuntu 20.04 after PHP 7.4 EOL is **not provided by The PHP group**, but by Canonical. We recommended updating to Chevereto V4 to keep using a PHP version with active support.

## Next version

V3.20 is the **final version** for [3.X](https://releases.chevereto.com/3.X/). For future Chevereto updates and support head over to [Chevereto V4](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/)
