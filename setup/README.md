# Introduction

Setting up Chevereto requires a server environment where the software and uploaded files will be served.

::: tip VPS recommended
If you are just getting started with self-hosted applications, we recommend you to follow the [root install](./root-install.md) guide. The root install guide covers everything the server needs to run the software.

## System requirements

Your server must meet the system [requirements](./requirements.md). It is very likely to encounter server issues if your server doesn't strictly meet the system requirements. Always double-check that the requirements are being provisioned.

## Installing

There are many different [install](./install.md) methods that you can follow depending of what kind of server you choose. The guide contains all the known installation procedures.

There are also many [user contributed](../contributed.md) installation guides that you can follow.
