# Container

This guide is for bootstrapped container based provisioning for Chevereto using system images published at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chevereto/chevereto).

This provisioning uses containers to provide only the servicing layer, the **application is provided on first container run** and re-used from there. As Chevereto ahead releases are distributed under a proprietary license, we can't mass distribute the application code to public so we provide the system servicing required for it.

::: tip Private builds
Follow the [Container registry](container-registry.md) guide to learn how to level-up your container provisioning by easily creating your private Chevereto application containers.
