# Container Bootstrapped

::: v4
Check the updated documentation at [ðŸ›¸ Docker Bootstrap](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/guides/docker/bootstrap.html).
:::

With our Docker bootstrapped repo you can quickly spawn Chevereto on Docker as it uses our public available system layers.

ðŸ‘‰ Check the repository at [chevereto/v3-docker](https://github.com/chevereto/v3-docker) for instructions.

Bootstrap means that the application layer is provided on container run (not at container image layer). This method is recommended when you install Chevereto in your local computer, for testing and development purposes as it doesn't require to build any image.
