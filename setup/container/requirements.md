# Container Requirements

To use containers you need a container engine, besides [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) there's a [list of software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_containers) you can use.

You will also need to get used to build your own Chevereto container images, which may be deal breaker for most users. Don't worry, our [Container Registry](registry.md) guide uses **GitHub Actions** to reduce the complexity of this to simple one-click actions.
